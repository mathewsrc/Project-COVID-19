# Project-COVID-19
This project aims to implement some machine learning models to predict COVID-19 evolution

This project use two methods available to forecast COVID-19 cases in Brazil: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) e Prophet. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects and ARIMA is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the information in the past values of the time series can alone be used to predict the future values. In this project ARIMA was used to forecast confirmed cases in Brazil in the next 30 days and Prophet to predict next confirmed cases in Brazil.
